# katalet-open-closed
A Open/Closed Principle micro workshop

This is an attempt to design a curriculum for developers of all abilities to level up quickly via deliberate real world experience.

## How to use the curriculum

Simply read the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d//) or doc file to learn about the issue.

Checkout the runnable code under src/{fav-language} that violates the learned pattern.

Have fun fixing it. :)

Explore new options, do it "wrong," do it "right," do it again.
